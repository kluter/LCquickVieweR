LCquickVieweR
---
The R package `LCquickVieweR` makes land-use change visible by creating false color images. 
The methodical approach is a combination of Image Differencing and Multi Temporal Stacking using NDVI.
This way change is coded by color. All preprocessing steps are automatized.

In this stage [0.0.1] the number of functions is customized for my latest project, but they can be adjusted easily.
`LCquickVieweR` was built for an analysis during my remote sensing major at University WÃ¼rzburg.

## Functions
This R package provides a small set of functions, namely:

-   `deltaNDVI()`
-   `getDeltaNDVI()`
-   `getNDVI()`
-   `Landsat5_NDVI()`
-   `Landsat8_NDVI()`
-   `mergeThis()`
-   `NDVI()`
-   `packageChecker()`
-   `packageChecker()`
-   `stackTime()`
-   `subsetThis()`

-   `backslashConverter()`
-   `set.wd()`
